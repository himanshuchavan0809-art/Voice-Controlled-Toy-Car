# Voice-Controlled-Toy-Car
Voice Controlled Toy Car using ESP32 and Bluetooth communication. Converts speech-to-text commands from a mobile app to control motor direction and movement in real time.

**Project Overview**

The Voice Controlled Toy Car is an embedded systems project that allows a toy car to be controlled using voice commands. Speech commands are converted into text on a smartphone and transmitted wirelessly via Bluetooth to a microcontroller (ESP32/Arduino), which then controls the motors accordingly.
This project demonstrates the practical application of speech recognition, Bluetooth communication, and motor control, making it ideal for academic submissions and beginner-to-intermediate embedded system learners.
